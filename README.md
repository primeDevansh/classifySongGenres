# Classify Song Genres from Audio Data

This project is from DataCamp projects. They provide the Dataset, the context,
and some instructions. The project can be found on [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/449).

## Project Description

Using a dataset comprised of songs of two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock), trained a classifier to distinguish between the two genres based only on track information derived from Echonest (now part of Spotify). First made use of **pandas** and **seaborn** packages in Python for subsetting the data, aggregating information, and creating plots when exploring the data for obvious trends or factors we should be aware of when doing machine learning. Next, used the **scikit-learn** package to predict whether we can correctly classify a song's genre based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc. Went over implementations of common algorithms such as PCA, logistic regression, decision trees, and so forth.
